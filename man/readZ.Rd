\title{Read the structure and explain it}
\usage{
readZ(
  Z = Z,
  B = NULL,
  crit = c("none", "R2", "F", "sigmaX"),
  varnames = NULL,
  output = c("index", "names", "all"),
  X = NULL,
  order = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{binary adjacency matrix of the structure (size p)}

\item{B}{is the complete structure (Z with sub-regression coefficients instead of 1 and an additional first line for the intercepts)}

\item{crit}{define the criterion to use: c("none","R2","F","sigmaX")}

\item{varnames}{the names of the variables (size p)}

\item{output}{indicates the content of the output: c("index","names","all")}

\item{X}{is a data frame or matrix containing the dataset}

\item{order}{define the order used (0: none, -1: decreasing, 1: growing) for printing}
}
\value{
a list containing the sub-regressions details. Each item of the list represents
a subregression. First element is the R-square.Second element is the variable that is regressed by others.
Then comes the list of the explicative variables in the subgression and the associated coefficients (in the first column).
}
\description{
This function describes the structure of sub-regression given by an adjacency matrix. It computes the associated regression coefficients and R-squared for each sub-regression.
}
\examples{
data <- mtcars
# we first search a sub-regression structure
res <- structureFinder(X = data, nbini = 30, verbose = 0)
# then we can try to interpret it
readZ(Z = res$Z_opt, crit = "R2", output = "all", X = data)
# each component is a sub-regression
# First line: The adjusted R-squared is given
# Second line: the name of the covariate that is regressed by others
# other lines: Coefficients of sub-regression and name of the associated covariate
