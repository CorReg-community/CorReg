\arguments{
\item{X}{the dataset (matrix)}

\item{nbclustmax}{max number of clusters in the gaussian mixtures}

\item{nbclustmin}{min number of clusters in the gaussian mixtures}

\item{verbose}{verbose or not}

\item{detailed}{boolean to give the details of the mixtures found}

\item{max}{boolean. Use an heuristic to shrink nbclustmax according to the number of individuals in the dataset}

\item{package}{package to use ("Rmixmod", "mclust")}

\item{nbini}{number of initial points for Rmixmod}

\item{matshape}{boolean to give the detail in matricial shape}

\item{...}{additional parameters}
}
\value{
a list that contains:
\item{BIC_vect}{vector of the BIC (one per variable)}
\item{BIC}{global value of the BIC (\code{=sum(BIC_vect)})}
\item{nbclust}{vector of the numbers of components}
\item{details}{list of matrices that describe each Gaussian Mixture (proportions, means and variances)}
}
\description{
Estimates the density of each covariates with gaussian mixture models and then gives the associated BIC.
