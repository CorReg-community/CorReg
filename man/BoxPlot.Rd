\title{Boxplot with confidence interval and ANOVA on the plot.}
\usage{
BoxPlot(
  num,
  grp = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  AnoVa = TRUE,
  risk = 0.05,
  lang = c("en", "fr"),
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{num}{a numeric vector to plot boxplot(num~grp). Represents the value that will be compared between the groups.}

\item{grp}{a qualitative vector (factor) to plot boxplot(num~grp). Represents the groups we will compare.}

\item{data}{a data.frame (or list) from which the variables in formula should be taken.}

\item{AnoVa}{boolean to compute or not anova (when multiple groups) to see if they differ in mean.If false the Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test is computed instead.}

\item{risk}{the risk value used for confidence intervals.}

\item{lang}{lingustic parameter to specify the language of the legend}

\item{verbose}{boolean to make a test and print the result in the subtitle}

\item{...}{Other graphical parameters}
}
\description{
classical boxplot function improved with integrated confidence level on the mean for each group ploted on the graph and also ANOVA with p-value and its interpretation given in the legend.

\examples{
repart = c(20, 40, 40)
X = data.frame(num = c(rnorm(repart[1], 10, 1), rnorm(repart[2], 11, 1), rnorm(repart[3], 10, 1)),
               grp = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), repart))


BoxPlot(X$num, X$grp, data = X, ylab = "num", main = "boxplot with confidence intervals")
# Confidence interval in red with mean in blue.
